# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring and organizing an existing Node.js/Express TypeScript backend that acts as a proxy to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance APIs. The primary focus is to fix existing API integration issues by properly using the yahoofinance2 package according to its documentation, while restructuring the code following senior backend engineering practices. Redis caching will be implemented as an optional enhancement at the end.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Yahoo Finance Integration (Primary Focus)

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to properly integrate with Yahoo Finance APIs using the yahoofinance2 package, so that I can reliably fetch stock market data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with Yahoo Finance THEN the system SHALL use proper API methods that exist in yahoofinance2 package based on official documentation
2. WHEN fetching market data THEN the system SHALL handle API response formats correctly according to yahoofinance2 specifications
3. WHEN API methods are unavailable THEN the system SHALL use documented alternative approaches
4. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL be transformed into consistent response formats
5. WHEN implementing endpoints THEN the system SHALL follow yahoofinance2 best practices and examples

### Requirement 2: API Endpoints Implementation

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to access various stock market data through well-defined REST endpoints, so that I can display financial information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call GET /indexes THEN the system SHALL return market indexes data (S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, etc.)
2. WHEN I call GET /gainers THEN the system SHALL return top gaining stocks
3. WHEN I call GET /losers THEN the system SHALL return top losing stocks  
4. WHEN I call GET /active THEN the system SHALL return most actively traded stocks
5. WHEN I call GET /spotlight THEN the system SHALL return featured stock with detailed description
6. WHEN I call GET /news THEN the system SHALL return latest financial news
7. WHEN any endpoint is called THEN the response SHALL be in consistent JSON format
8. WHEN invalid requests are made THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 3: TypeScript Compliance and Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want full TypeScript compliance with proper type definitions, so that the code is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be no type errors
2. WHEN external libraries are used THEN proper type imports SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN API responses are handled THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions
4. WHEN function parameters are used THEN they SHALL have explicit type annotations
5. WHEN interfaces are needed THEN they SHALL be properly defined and exported

### Requirement 4: Code Organization and Architecture

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the codebase to be properly organized with clear separation of concerns, so that it's maintainable and follows industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN it SHALL have separate directories for controllers, services, routes, middleware, and configuration
2. WHEN code is organized THEN each module SHALL have a single responsibility
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables
4. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN all type errors SHALL be resolved and proper type imports SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling throughout the application, so that failures are gracefully managed and properly logged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external API calls fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with meaningful messages
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly logged with sufficient detail for debugging
3. WHEN the Yahoo Finance API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return clear error messages
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN sensitive information SHALL NOT be exposed to clients

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to be configurable through environment variables, so that it can be deployed across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN Redis connection details are needed THEN they SHALL be configurable via environment variables
3. WHEN server port is specified THEN it SHALL be configurable with a default fallback
4. WHEN API timeouts are configured THEN they SHALL be adjustable per environment
5. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults or fail gracefully

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization with Caching (Optional Enhancement)

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast response times for frequently requested data, so that the application performs efficiently under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint is called THEN the system MAY check Redis cache first before making external API calls
2. WHEN cached data exists and is less than 1 minute old THEN the system MAY return cached data
3. WHEN cached data is stale or doesn't exist THEN the system MAY fetch fresh data and update the cache
4. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function without caching
5. WHEN cache keys are created THEN they SHALL be properly namespaced and have appropriate TTL values
